The Intersection observer is used to detect when an element (e.g. `<img>`, `<p>`, or `<div>`) enters or leaves the user's browser viewport.

You can also add options to the observer, like setting a threshold.

Threshold values range from `0` to `1` 

`1` means that every single pixel of the element has to be in the viewport for the callback to run. 

`0` is the default value and means that just one pixel must be intersecting for the callback to run.

Here is an example of the use of the `threshold` option in an intersection observer in the [Animated story](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/animated-story) project (part of the [More Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/more-web) path).

The option `threshold: 1` in this example means the callback only triggers when all of the snail image is in the viewport.

snailObserver.observe(document.querySelector("#snail"));
